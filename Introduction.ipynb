    "\n",
    "Sequencing studies have statistically implicated genetic drivers of human cancers by distinguishing these from the expected random accumulation of somatic mutations. However, prior work has coarsely focused on driver genes or regions, largely avoiding prediction of individual mutations. Here, we develop and rigorously validate CHASM2 to predict individual driver somatic missense mutations and show it exceeds state-of-the-art performance. Applied to 32 cancer types, CHASM2 identifies 3,527 unique drivers with four times higher prevalence of rare drivers than previously calculated. Our results indicate a complex relationship between the driver landscape of somatic missense mutations and each cancer type, some reveal a prominent role for rare drivers while others rely on common drivers and are already saturating discovery. We show experimentally that CHASM2 discriminates radiosensitivity mutations within the ATM gene, a phenotype of potential clinical relevance. The prevalence of rare cancer drivers has implications for future interpretation of cancer genomes and genome-driven oncology.\n",

    "### Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "We have prepared jupyter notebooks to record our analysis of CHASM2. You can use these notebooks and associated data to look at alternative methods which we have already analyzed, but also potentially compare additional new methods to these established results. For running your own methods, you will need to execute the method yourself on the same mutations and modify the data yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Download\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to be in the directory you would like to use for this protocol. The first step is to obtain the example data. You can use the wget command in bash to download the example data. On Mac, you may need to first install the wget command via HomeBrew by brew install wget. In the following command we assume you are in the top-level directory. On windows you will need to download the file from the URL (without wget) and place it in the jupyter notebook directory.\n",

    "#### Directory structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"data\" folder contains raw data used as input for analysis. The Generated supplementary tables and figures are saved in the \"results\" and \"figures\" folders, respectively. Saved [chimera sessions](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/) for visualizing the CHASM2 results for ATM, ERBB2, and PPP2R1A are found in the chimera directory."
